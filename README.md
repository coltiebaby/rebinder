# Rebinder

Just a little experiment with C, RUST, and Bindgen.

## Remixer

small c lib that contains a few functions to that should be called with `rustmixer`

## Rustmixer

small rust lib that just runs a test to check if we can call the c lib. Once built you
can view what bindgen set by viewing the bindings.rs file that is created in `rustmixer/bindings.rs`
